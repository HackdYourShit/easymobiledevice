#Easymobiledevice 0.1

=== ENGLISH ===

Easymobiledevice is a command line interface to help you to use easier libimobiledevice.
I've already release a Perl script for Easymobiledevice, but it's in French, I'll translate it soon.

Before executing this programm you'll need to install libimobiledevice.
Your can use @Elro74's scripts which install dependencies and compile it automaticly.
I added these scripts to the project.

If you need some help contact me on Twitter : matteyeux
 
### For Linux
You have to run these commands :

chmod +x apt-get.sh <br>
 `./apt-get.sh` <br>
`./autobuild.sh` <br>

### For MAC OS X
You have to run this command : 

`./brew.sh``

This utility works for Linux and OS X.
A Windows version will come later this year (I hope).
A perl version has been already released.

#TODO

Add some features like iFuse and other stuff in the 0.2 version.
Add license for open source code.
