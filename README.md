#Easymobiledevice 0.4

=== ENGLISH ===

Easymobiledevice is a command line interface to help you to use easier libimobiledevice.
I've already release a Perl script for Easymobiledevice, but it's in French, I'll translate it soon.

Before executing this program you'll need to install libimobiledevice.
Your can use @Elro74's scripts which installs dependencies and compile it automaticly.
I added these scripts to the project.

If you need some help contact me on Twitter : matteyeux
 
This utility works for Linux and OS X.
A Windows version will come later this year (I hope).
A perl version has been already released.<br>

#Installing libimobiledevice
You can easily install libimobile using Elrhk's scripts in the installer folder.

###Linux 
`chmod +x apt-get.sh && ./apt-get.sh`
then `./autobuild.sh`

###OS X

`./brew.sh`
then `./autobuild.sh` 

Maybe you'll have to fixe the script at your own. <br>

#TODO

Add some features like iFuse and other stuff.<br> 
Add license for open source code.<br> 
French version of the Readme<br>
