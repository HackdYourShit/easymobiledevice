#Easymobiledevice 0.4

=== ENGLISH ===

Easymobiledevice is a command line interface to help you to use easier libimobiledevice.

Before executing this program you'll need to install libimobiledevice.
Linux & OS users can use @Elro74's scripts which installs dependencies and compile it automaticly.
I added these scripts to the project, in the installer folder.

For windows you have to download [Libimobiledevice for Windows](https://github.com/matteyeux/easymobiledevice/releases/download/plop/Libimobiledevice.zip) Windows binary of easymobiledevice is already in this folder.

#Installing libimobiledevice
You can easily install libimobiledevice using DevJam's scripts in the installer folder.

###Linux 
cd to the installer directory. <br>
`chmod +x apt-get.sh && ./apt-get.sh`
then `./autobuild.sh`

###OS X

`./brew.sh`
then `./autobuild.sh` 

Maybe you'll have to fixe the script at your own. <br>
