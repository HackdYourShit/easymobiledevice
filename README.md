#Easymobiledevice 0.1

=== ENGLISH === <br>

Easymobiledevice is a command line interface to help you to use easier libimobiledevice. <br>
I've already release a Perl script for Easymobiledevice, but it's in French, I'll translate it soon. <br>

Before executing this programm you'll need to install libimobiledevice. <br>
Your can use @Elro74's scripts which install dependencies and compile it automaticly. <br>
I added these scripts to the project. <br>

If you need some help contact me on Twitter : matteyeux <br>
 
### For Linux
You have to run these commands :  <br>

chmod +x apt-get.sh  <br>
./apt-get.sh <br>
./autobuild.sh <br>

### For MAC OS X
You have to run this command :  <br> 

./brew.sh  <br>

This utility works for Linux and OS X. <br>
A Windows version will come later this year (I hope). <br>
A perl version has been already released. <br>

#TODO

Add some features like iFuse and other stuff in the 0.2 version. <br>
Add license for open source code. <br>
